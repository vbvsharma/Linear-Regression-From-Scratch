# Linear Regression

Implement linear regression from scratch in Python and get to see it work on data. This mini project contains a data file (data.txt) and a Python script (LinearRegression.py). The Python script contains all the necessary steps needed to implement linear regression from scratch.

The data file has 3 columns:

                   | Size of House (in sq-ft) | Number of Bedrooms | Price of House (in $) |
                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   |            ...           |         ...        |          ...          |
                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------


In linear regression we will be using size of house and number of bedrooms as features to estimate the price of a house.

Methods used in linear regression:
 - **Gradient Descent**
 - **Normal Equations**
